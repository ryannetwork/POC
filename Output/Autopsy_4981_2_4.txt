clear fluid. The cut surface reveals a normal appearing cortex
and medulla with intact calyces. The prostate and seminal
vessels were cut revealing normal appearing prostate and
seminal vesicle tissue without evidence of inflammation or
embolus.,ENDOCR|NE SYSTEM, The adrenal glands are in
the normal position and weigh 8.0 grams on the right and 11.6
grams on the left. The cut surface of the adrenal glands
reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla. The thyroid
gland weighs 12.4 grams and is grossly
normal.,EXTREMlT|ES:, Both legs and calves were measured
and found to be very similar in circumference. Both legs were
also milked and produced no clots in the venous
system.,CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CORRELATION,This patient
died shortly after a previous pulmonary embolus completely
occluded the right pulmonary artery vasculature., ,The most
significant finding on autopsy was the presence of multiple old
and new thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature of the
right lung. The autopsy revealed evidence of multiple emboli
in the right lung that were at least a few days old because the
emboli that were organizing were adherent to the vessel wall.
In order to be adherent to the vessel wall, the emboli must be
in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response, which
takes at least a few days. The fatal event was not the old
emboli in the right lung, but rather the thrombosis on top of the
large saddle thrombus residing in the pulmonary artery. This
created a high-pressure situation that the right ventricle could
not handle resulting in cardiac dysfunction and ultimately the
patient's demise.,Although this case is fairly straight fonNard in
