midlarynx, over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle; it is
gaping, measuring 3 inches in length with smooth edges. lt
tapers superiorly to 1 inch in length cut skin. Dissection
discloses that the wound path is through the skin, the
subcutaneous tissue, and the sternocleidomastoid muscle
with hemorrhage along the wound path and transection of the
left internal jugular vein, with dark red-purple hemorrhage in
the adjacent subcutaneous tissue and fascia. The direction of
the pathway is upward and slightly front to back for a distance
of approximately 4 inches where it exits, post-auricular, in a 2
inch in length gaping stab/incised wound which has
undulating or wavy borders, but not serrated. lntersecting the
wound at right angle superior inferior is a 2 inch in length
interrupted superficial, linear incised wound involving only the
skin. Also, intervening between the 2 gaping stab-incised
wounds is a horizontally oriented 3-1/2 inch in length
interrupted superficial, linear incised wound of the skin only. In
addition, there is a 1/2 inch long, linear-triangular in size
wound of the inferior portion of the left earlobe. The direction
of the sharp force injury is upward (rostral), and slightly front
to back with no significant angulation or deviation. The total
length of the wound path is approximately 4 inches. However,
there is a 3/4 inch in length, linear, cutting or incised wound of
the top or superior aspect of the pinna of the left ear; a
straight metallic probe placed through the major sharp force
injury shows that the injury of the superior part of the ear can
be aligned with the straight metallic rod, suggesting that the 3
injuries are related; in this instance the total length of the
