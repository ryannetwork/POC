neck, right side, posterior to the ear and posterior border of
the right sternocleidomastoid muscle there is vertically
oriented superficial incised skin wound, measuring 3/4 inch in
length.,4. There are numerous superficial incised wounds or
cuts, varied in orientation, involving the skin of the right cheek,
intersection and mingled with the various superficial incised
wounds described above. The longest is a 3 inch long
diagonally oriented superficial incised wound extending from
the right side of the forehead to the cheek; various other
superficial wound vary from 1/2 to 1 inch.,5. On the right side
of the cheek, adjacent to the ramus of the mandible, right,
there is a 1-1/2 x 3/4 inch superficial nonpatterned red-brown
abrasion with irregular border, extending superiorly towards
the angle of the jaw where there are poorly defined and
circumscribed abrasions adjacent to the superficial cuts or
abrasions described above. It should be noted that the 5th
superficial incised wound of the right side of the mandible
which measures 5/8 inch in length is tapered on the posterior
aspect and forked on the anterior aspect where it has a width
of 1/32 inch.,6. On the left ear, there is a superficial incised
wound measuring 1/4 inch, adjacent to the posterior border of
the pinna. Just below this on the inferior pinna, extending to
the earlobe, there is an interrupted superficial linear abrasion
measuring 1 inch in length.
