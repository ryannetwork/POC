terms of what caused the terminal event, perhaps the more
interesting question is why a relatively healthy 35-year-old
man would develop a fatal pulmonary embolism. Virchow's
triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury, stasis
and a hypercoagulable state as possible etiologies. The age
of the patient probably precludes venous stasis as the sole
reason for the embolus although it could have certainly
contributed. The autopsy revealed no evidence of endothelial
damage in the pulmonary vasculature that would have caused
the occlusion. The next logical reason would be a
hypercoagulable state. Some possibilities include obesity,
trauma, surgery, cancer, Factor V Leiden deficiency (as well
as other inherited disorders-prothrombin gene mutation,
deficiencies in protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III, and
disorders of plasminogen), and Lupus anticoagulant. Of these
risks factors, obesity was the only risk factor the patient was
known to have. The patient had no evidence of trauma,
surgery, cancer or the stigmata of SLE, therefore these are
unlikely. Perhaps the most fruitful search would be an
examination of the genetic possibilities for a hypercoagulable
state (Factor V Leiden being the most common).,ln summary,
this patient died of a pulmonary embolism, the underlying
cause of which is currently undetermined. A definitive
diagnosis may be ascertained with either genetic or other
laboratory tests and a more detailed history.,SUMMARY AND
REFLECTION,WHAT l LEARNED FROM THIS AUTOPSY:, I
learned that although a cause of death may sometimes be
obvious, the underlying mechanism for the death may still be
