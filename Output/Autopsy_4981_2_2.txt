There are multiple small areas of hemorrhage bilaterally in the
conjunctiva. A nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are in
place. There is an intravenous line in the right hand and left
femoral region. The patient has multiple lead pads on the
thorax. The patient has no other major surgical
scars.,|NTERNAL EXAMINATION (BODY CAVITIES):, The
right and left pleural cavity contains 10 ml of clear fluid with no
adhesions. The pericardial sac is yellow, glistening without
adhesions or fibrosis and contains 30 ml of a straw colored
fluid. There is minimal fluid in the peritoneal cavity.,HEART:,
The heart is large with a normal shape and a weight of 400
grams. The pericardium is intact. The epicardial fat is diffusely
firm. As patient was greater than 48 hours post mortem, no
TTC staining was utilized. Upon opening the heart was
grossly normal without evidence of infarction. There were
slightly raised white plaques in the left ventricle wall lining.
The left ventricle measures 2.2 cm, the right ventricle
measures 0.2 cm, the tricuspid ring measures 11 cm, the
pulmonic right measures 8 cm, the mitral ring measures 10.2
cm, and the aortic ring measures 7 cm. The foramen ovale is
closed. The circulation is left dominant. Examination of the
great vessels of the heart reveals minimal atherosclerosis with
the area of greatest stenosis (20% stenosis) at the bifurcation
of the LAD.,AORTA:, There is minimal atherosclerosis with no
measurable plaques along the full length of the ascending and
descending aorta.,LUNGS: , The right lung weighed 630
grams, the left weighed 710 grams. The lung parenchyma is
pink without evidence of congestion of hemorrhage. The
